# Console

Java and Arduino code for next-gen operator console.

The Arduino code emulates a USB Joystick device, with up to
32 buttons, 8 motion axes, and 16 LED outputs.

To build the Arduino part, you use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software),
and you need to install the
[Arduino Joystick Library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary),
as described (using the Arduino IDE's "Add zip library" feature).
