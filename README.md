# Console

Java and Arduino code for FRC operator console.

The Arduino code emulates a USB Joystick device, with up to
32 buttons, 8 motion axes, and 16 LED outputs.

To build the Arduino part, you use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
Set your "workbook" to the arduino directory to pick up the required libraries.

There's an example Fusion 360 assembly for laser-cut panels [here.](https://a360.co/3Fu8oDa)
If anybody knows how to share the entire Fusion 360 project, please let me know.
